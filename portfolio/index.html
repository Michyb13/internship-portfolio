      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        During my internship at Oryx Africa, I mainly focused on Machine
        Learning and Artificial Intelligence using Python. I became proficient
        in scikit-learn and data analysis packages, and learned to incorporate
        trained models into applications using the Flask framework for backend
        development.

        <h3>Salary Predictor</h3>
        <p>
          Using a public salary dataset, I built a salary predictor based on
          certain parameters. The project involved data cleaning, feature
          selection, and model building using a random forest regression model.
          The final model can predict salaries based on inputs such as years of
          experience, education level, and job title. I also created a web
          interface using Flask and Nextjs to allow users to input their details
          and get salary predictions.

        <h3>Customer Revenue Predictor</h3>
        <p>
          Using a company's dataset, I developed a revenue predictor for
          customers. This project required extensive data analysis to identify
          key revenue-driving factors. I used a random forest regression model
          to predict future revenues based on a customer id, month and the year.
          The project also included creating a user-friendly web application
          with Flask for the backend, Nextjs for the frontend and MongoDb and
          MySQL stimuating a database allowing the company's sales team to input
          customer data and receive revenue predictions, which can assist in
          strategic decision-making. The application also includes
          authentication using JWT and has a self updating feature for the model
          that allows it to retrain the model periodically with new data from
          the company's database to maintain the model accuracy.
